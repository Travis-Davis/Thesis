Simulation parameters
1.  Normal distribution for floe radius with regular lattice spatial distribution
    Status: Implemented
2.  Southward wind Forcing
    Status: Implemented
3.  Still ocean
    Status: Implemented
4.  Funnel
    Status: Pending
    a. Implement Funnel Geometry: implemented
    b. Implement Relief Area:     partially-implemented//could stand to be larger
    c. Implement rounded corner:  Pending
       1. Round off corners in the funnel to eliminate point loading of particles.
